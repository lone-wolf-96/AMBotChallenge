# [AMBotChallenge](https://github.com/lone-wolf-96/AMBotChallenge/)

This was a personal challenge, to create a bot using Microsoft Bot Framework for Node.js.

## Getting Started

This was made time ago, so some of the APIs probably don't work by now.

### Installation

It requires no other installation than having Node.js.

### Other instructions

Some other instructions can be found here [Poker Calculator in JavaScript](https://github.com/lone-wolf-96/poker-calculator-js/).
Nevertheless, this is a basic project with one only file.
